Male Fantasy Sports
===================

Male Fantasy Sports (Nationalism, Masculinity, and Sexuality in American Baseball and English Football) is a course I originally taught at the University of Chicago in Winter 2008. It was listed as [ENGL 25917 / GNDR 21803](http://english.uchicago.edu/course_search/results/fantasy%20sports). The initial commit of this syllabus is a rebuilding of the syllabus from that original class, and then later commits show how my thinking has changed.

The original course description in Chicago's Time Schedules read:

> This class investigates how sexuality, masculinity, and nationalism work in novels about experiencing baseball and soccer. Students will read some primer texts on nationalism and masculinity in the first few classes--Anderson and maybe Gellner for the nationalism, and the masculinity and sexuality stuff will come through Mosse, Theuweleit, Connell, Probyn, and Foucault. The students will then read 3 novels about baseball, in which we'll spend most of our time talking about the relationship between sports, the nuclear family, and the reproduction of the American. Next follow three literary objects about football hooligans in England, tracking how they handle their national calls to be masculine in following both the English national team and their own specific club teams. The course closes with readings about sports as a universalizing force in our transnational era.

This structure of this GitHub syllabus is based on Mark Sample's [Videogame Studies](https://github.com/samplereality/videogame-studies) syllabus, in how it is presented on GitHub.
